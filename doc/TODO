TODO

- avoid duplicates when posting new messages
- avoid duplicates when posting new threads

- use scope for archived/not archived instead of querying in the controller index

- use the form helpers instead of writing everything on your own

- some funky stuff is going on with the routes, I think we should fix it without the match
  lines, it fucks up everything which is good in rails, none of the helpers work anymore
