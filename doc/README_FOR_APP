= Starting development

Before you can start what you will need is:
- ruby >= 1.9
- rails >= 3.1.x
- mongodb

You can find the db name, port and host in /config/database.yml 
We use the default port so after a install with

brew install mongodb

you just start it with

mongod run


== Coning the repo
git clone ssh://cforum-git@painkiller.defunced.de/var/lib/git/cforum.git cforum
cd cforum
bundle install

When mongodb is running you can start the development server like always in rails with

rails s
